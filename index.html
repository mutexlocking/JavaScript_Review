                <h2>What is the apple silicon?</h2>

                <p> 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_silicon" target="_blank" title="go to the wikipedia">Apple silicon</a> is a series of system on a chip (SoC) and system in a package (SiP) processors designed by Apple Inc., mainly using the ARM architecture. 
                    <br/>It is the basis of Mac computers as well as iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, and Apple Watch, and of products such as AirPods, HomePod, iPod Touch, and AirTag.
                    <br/>As of late 2021, Apple is switching Mac computers from Intel processors to Apple silicon. This plan was announced at WWDC 2020 on June 22, 2020; 
                    <br/>the first Macs built around the Apple M1 processor were unveiled on November 10, 2020.
                    <br/>Apple outsources the chips' manufacture but fully controls their integration with the company's hardware and software. Johny Srouji is in charge of Apple's silicon design.
